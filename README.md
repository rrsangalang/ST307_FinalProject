Our goal in this project was to analyze data taken from a data set containing information on lakes mostly from Maine. We had four main objectives:
1.	Determined if the average mercury level and the log of the mercury levels in the lakes differ for the different lake types. We wanted to produce simultaneous 90% confidence intervals for the difference in average mercury levels for the lake types.
2.	Conducted correlation analysis between Mercury, Elevation, Surface Area, Drainage Area, and Flushing Rate
3.	Ran a model to investigate the linear relationship between log of Mercury (response) and Flushing Rate (predictor).  Had SAS produce a 99% confidence interval for the slope parameter.
4.	Produced a 99% confidence interval for the mean value of log mercury at a lake with flushing rate 0.78
